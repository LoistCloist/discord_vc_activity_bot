# discord_vc_activity_bot
This discord bot will notify me if there are any active voice calls in the servers the bot is in.
!lelper - the bot will now notify you of servers that are active.
!lelperStop - the bot will not stop notifying you of servers that are active.
!setBotChannel - the bot will consider this to be the active bot channel.
